# Lottery Luck!
Lottery luck is just a simple parsing app to parse through the CA-Lottery Mega Millions draw results to see if there really is any lucky numbers out there, at least based on statistics. This is a simple HTML/Javascript app that parses through a txt document provided by the CA Lottery (source: http://www.calottery.com/sitecore/content/Miscellaneous/download-numbers/?GameName=mega-millions). In theory, this app can be modified to parse through any other text based results they have, though a few modifications on `numbers` JSON will need to be made.
